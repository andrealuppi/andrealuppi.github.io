abstract: The human brain is characterized by idiosyncratic patterns of spontaneous thought, rendering each brain uniquely identifiable from its neural activity. However, deep general anaesthesia suppresses subjective experience. Does it also suppress what makes each brain unique? Here we used functional MRI scans acquired under the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane and propofol to determine whether anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness diminishes the uniqueness of the human brain, both with respect to the brains of other individuals and the brains of another species. Using functional connectivity, we report that under anaesthesia individual brains become less self-similar and less distinguishable from each other. Loss of distinctiveness is highly organized; it co-localizes with the archetypal sensoryâ€“association axis, correlating with genetic and morphometric markers of phylogenetic differences between humans and other primates. This effect is more evident at greater anaesthetic depths, reproducible across sevoflurane and propofol and reversed upon recovery. Providing convergent evidence, we show that anaesthesia shifts the functional connectivity of the human brain closer to the functional connectivity of the macaque brain in a low-dimensional space. Finally, anaesthesia diminishes the match between spontaneous brain activity and cognitive brain patterns aggregated from the Neurosynth meta-analytic engine. Collectively, the present results reveal that anaesthetized human brains are not only less distinguishable from each other, but also less distinguishable from the brains of other primates, with specifically human-expanded regions being the most affected by anaesthesia.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Anaesthesia makes human brains less distinguishable from one another, and less distinguishable from the brains of monkeys. We also introduce 'cognitive matching' with NeuroSynth.
